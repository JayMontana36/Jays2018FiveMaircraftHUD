Installation:
1. Build the dll using Visual Studio with FiveM (cfx.re) references and requirements.
2. Create a FiveM resource and place the compiled dll file inside, edit your server.cfg and add "start (resourcename)" (or "ensure (resourcename)") to the resource list.

Standalone Resource for FiveM
Created by JayMontana36 for FSFE (Flight Simulator FiveM Edition) back in 2018 and the FiveM community.

Disclaimer: This code has not been touched or updated at all since the end of 2018, I don't necessarily recommend you to use this because of a few bugs it has (such as displaying the game's raw heading rather than doing simple math (360 minus game heading) to correct the game's incorrect heading readings which you can easily do yourself) alongside the fact that if you want perfect accuracy you'll need more than just this alone, and I will not provide any support for anything having to do with this resource. But, if all you want/need is a simple lightweight Plane/Heli HUD for FiveM then well here you go! (Formerly called PlaneHUD)
